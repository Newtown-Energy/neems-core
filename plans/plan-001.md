Below is a series of queries and responses.  It is a record of my
exchange with an llm.  It describes the goal I am trying to achieve,
the action plan, and the steps I have taken so far.  The final query
lacks a response.  That is where you come in.  Guide me through the
next step by responding to that query.

QUERY:

I want to add login support to my rust rocket api server.  I have two repos.  One is the rust rocket back end.  The other is a vite react typescript front end.  The front end calls the back end by accessing routes starting with /api/1.

I want to use the rocket_auth2 crate, as it appears to be recent and well-maintained.  I am open to other suggestions though.

Login flow will need to include totp.

There is an sqlite database with a user table and a user model.

I have set rocket's SECRET_KEY configuration to a secret that rocket can use to sign things (e.g. a JWT)

I want to instrument the backend for login support and write some tests to exercise the new code.  Give me a high-level view of the steps I'll need to take.  Ask me questions to guide me through considerations, don't just present options.

RESPONSE:

To add **login support with TOTP** to your Rust Rocket API, integrating with your existing SQLite-backed user model and a Vite/React frontend, here’s a high-level roadmap and some guiding questions to clarify your requirements and constraints.

### 1. **Authentication Flow Design**

- **What is your preferred authentication token mechanism?**  
  Since you’ve set Rocket’s `SECRET_KEY`, JWTs are a natural fit for stateless APIs, but you could also use opaque session tokens stored in the database. JWTs are common for APIs with separate frontends, but revocation is harder unless you track them server-side[3][9]. Do you want to support single sign-out or token revocation?

- **How will the frontend store and send tokens?**  
  HTTP-only cookies are most secure, but cross-origin setups (different domains for API and frontend) complicate this[6]. Are you planning to use cookies, localStorage, or send tokens in headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer ...`)?

### 2. **User Registration and TOTP Setup**

- **How will users enroll in TOTP?**  
  On registration, generate a TOTP secret, store it in the user table, and provide a QR code for the user to scan with their authenticator app[1][7].  
  - Will you require TOTP for all users, or make it optional?

### 3. **Login Endpoint Implementation**

- **What should the login flow look like?**  
  Typically:
  1. User submits username and password.
  2. If valid, prompt for TOTP code.
  3. Verify TOTP using the stored secret.
  4. Issue a JWT (or session token) if both checks pass[1][7].

- **How will you handle login attempts and error feedback?**  
  Consider rate limiting, lockouts, and clear error messages for failed logins or invalid TOTP codes.

### 4. **Protecting API Routes**

- **How will you enforce authentication on protected routes?**  
  Implement a Rocket request guard (e.g., `FromRequest` for an `AuthenticatedUser` struct) that checks for a valid token in each request[3][9].  
  - Will you need role-based authorization, or is simple user authentication sufficient?

### 5. **Frontend Integration**

- **How will the frontend handle the login state and TOTP challenge?**  
  - Will you use a multi-step form/modal for username/password then TOTP?
  - How will you persist the token and send it with each API request?

### 6. **Testing**

- **What test coverage do you expect?**  
  - Unit tests for password and TOTP verification logic.
  - Integration tests for the full login flow (including TOTP).
  - End-to-end tests from the frontend, simulating user registration, login, and accessing protected routes[1].

### 7. **Security Considerations**

- **How will you securely store TOTP secrets and password hashes?**  
  Use strong hashing (e.g., Argon2 for passwords) and never log or expose secrets.

- **Do you need to support TOTP reset or backup codes?**  
  If users lose their device, how will they regain access[5]?

### 8. **Library Choices**

- **Are you committed to rocket_auth2, or open to alternatives?**  
  rocket_auth2 is new and maintained, but you might also consider using crates like `otpauth` for TOTP[7], `jsonwebtoken` for JWTs, and your own Rocket guards for session handling.  
  - Have you reviewed rocket_auth2’s documentation and confirmed it supports TOTP out of the box, or will you need to integrate TOTP separately?

### 9. **CORS and Cross-Origin Setup**

- **Have you configured CORS on your Rocket API to allow requests from your frontend?**  
  This is essential for local development and production, especially if domains differ[1][6].

## Next Steps

1. **Clarify your token/session mechanism** (JWT vs. opaque tokens, revocation needs).
2. **Decide on frontend token storage** (cookie vs. header).
3. **Determine TOTP enrollment/reset policies**.
4. **Sketch your login API endpoints** (registration, login, TOTP verification, protected resource).
5. **Plan your test strategy**.

**Which of these areas do you feel most uncertain about, or want to discuss in more detail?** For example:
- Are you comfortable with JWTs and their tradeoffs?
- Do you want example code for TOTP generation/verification in Rocket?
- How do you want to handle token revocation or logout?

Let me know your preferences and any constraints, and I can help you design the specifics and provide code samples for the critical pieces.

QUERY:

1. For authentication flow design, I do want to support single sign-out and token revocation support.

The frontend is a browser.  cookies and bearer tokens are the most appealing storage mechanisms.

2. TOTP will be mandatory.  For today, let's omit it from the flow.

3. That login flow is fine.  Rate limits, lockouts, error messages are required.

4. We will need role-based guards as well as user auth guards.  Right now, we don't have any secure endpoints, so today we should make some dummy endpoints just to demonstrate.

5. Yes, multi-step modal on the front end.  I haven't decided yet how to persist the token on the front end, but that is not today's task.

6. I will want to build that described set of test

7. Passwords should be hashed and stored with the hash method prepended (e.g. argon2:HASHGOESHERE).  If we can store TOTP hashes instead of secrets, lets do that.  

I hadn't thought about TOTP reset, but yes we should give the user some backup codes.

8.  rocket_auth2 doesn't do TOTP.  We will have to use other crates and/or new code to implement various features rocket_auth2 does not.

9.  I have done no CORS work

RESPONSE:

Great, your answers clarify your requirements and constraints. Here’s a **tailored high-level plan** for your next steps, with guiding questions and recommendations for each area. I’ll highlight key decisions and call out where you’ll want to make choices or gather more information.

## 1. Authentication Flow: Token Revocation & Single Sign-Out

**Since you want revocation and single sign-out:**
- **JWTs alone are not ideal** (since they’re stateless and hard to revoke).
- **Recommended:** Use opaque session tokens stored in a sessions table in your database. Store a session ID in a secure, HTTP-only cookie or send as a Bearer token.
- **Question:**  
  - Would you prefer cookies (most secure, but CORS is trickier) or Bearer tokens (easier CORS, but less secure in XSS scenarios)?
- **Implementation:**  
  - On login: create a session record, return the session token.
  - On logout: delete/invalidate the session.
  - On each request: check the session token against the database.

## 2. TOTP (Mandatory, but Omit for Now)

- For today, **skip TOTP** in the flow.  
- **Store TOTP secrets** securely for future use. (Hashing TOTP secrets is not standard; TOTP requires the raw secret to generate/verify codes. You can encrypt the secret at rest, but not hash it.)
- **Backup codes:** Plan to generate and store backup codes (hashed) per user for future implementation.

## 3. Login Flow: Rate Limits, Lockouts, Error Messages

- **Rate limiting:** Track login attempts per username/IP. Use a simple in-memory or database-backed counter.
- **Lockouts:** After X failed attempts, lock the user for Y minutes.
- **Error messages:** Be careful not to leak whether the username or password was incorrect.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Add a `failed_attempts` and `lockout_until` field to your user table, or use a separate table.

## 4. Role-Based and User Auth Guards

- **User Auth Guard:** Implement a Rocket request guard that checks for a valid session token and loads the user.
- **Role-Based Guard:** Add a `role` field to your user model (if not present) and create guards that check for required roles.
- **Dummy Endpoints:**  
  - `/api/1/secure/user` – requires any authenticated user.
  - `/api/1/secure/admin` – requires user with `admin` role.

## 5. Frontend Integration

- You’ll use a multi-step modal for login.  
- **Token persistence:** Not today’s task, but keep in mind that cookies require CORS setup.

## 6. Testing

- Plan for:
  - Unit tests for password verification, session creation, and guards.
  - Integration tests for login/logout and protected endpoints.
  - (Later) E2E tests with the frontend.

## 7. Password Hashing and TOTP Secret Storage

- **Password:** Store as `argon2:HASHGOESHERE`. Use the `argon2` crate.
- **TOTP:** Store the secret (possibly encrypted, not hashed). Hash backup codes.
- **Question:**  
  - Do you want to encrypt TOTP secrets at rest? If so, you’ll need a key management strategy.

## 8. Library Choices

- Use `rocket_auth2` for basic auth/session handling.
- Use `argon2` for password hashing.
- Use `otpauth` or `oath` for TOTP (for future work).
- For CORS, use Rocket’s [CORS fairing](https://github.com/lawliet89/rocket_cors).

## 9. CORS

- **You must configure CORS** to allow your frontend to call the backend.
- **Question:**  
  - Are your frontend and backend on the same domain/port in development? If not, you’ll need to allow cross-origin requests.

# Next Steps (Action Plan)

1. **Decide session token storage:**  
   - Cookie or Bearer token? (Recommend Bearer for now for simplicity and easier CORS.)
2. **Add session table and session management endpoints.**
3. **Implement login/logout endpoints with rate limiting and lockouts.**
4. **Implement Rocket request guards for user and role-based auth.**
5. **Add dummy secure endpoints.**
6. **Set up CORS using Rocket’s CORS fairing.**
7. **Write tests for login, session validation, and protected endpoints.**

## Questions for You

- **Do you want to use Bearer tokens for now, and switch to cookies later if needed?**
- **Do you want example schema/code for the session table and login/logout endpoints?**
- **Should I provide example Rocket guards for user and role-based auth?**
- **Do you want a sample CORS configuration for Rocket?**
- **Anything else you want to clarify or prioritize for today’s work?**

QUERY:

Let's do the first three steps of the Action Plan.

1. **Decide session token storage:**  
DONE: We will use opaque session tokens and store them as cookies.

2. **Add session table and session management endpoints.**
HALF DONE:

    Some subtasks remain:

    * Configure CORS and cookie settings for your frontend domain.

3. **Implement login/logout endpoints with rate limiting and lockouts.**
HALF DONE:

     In implementing session management endpoints, you guided me to
     making login and logout endpoints, so I appear to have partially
     done step 3.  Still to come: rate limiting and lockouts.

4. **Implement Rocket request guards for user and role-based auth.**
DONE

5. **Add dummy secure endpoints.**
6. **Set up CORS using Rocket’s CORS fairing.**
7. **Write tests for login, session validation, and protected endpoints.**
